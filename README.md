# LootOverhaul
This is a mod that adds a lot to the vanilla loot system!

If you're looking for the wiki, it's over here: https://github.com/Tmtravlr/LootOverhaul/wiki

If you're here for the code, read on. =)

## Using this as a library in another mod
There isn't an actual API right now, but I included the source code and deobf versions with the downloads in curseforge (in the "Additional Files" section if you click on the file's name).

If you want your mod to depend on this one, just load the deobf version as a library in your IDE, and use the source one to load the source code with all the javadoc and comments.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the code, you can create a pull request, and I'll review it when I have a chance.
